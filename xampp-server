XAMPP is a local server used to test or run php websites such as Wordpress.
First we have to download XAMPP for window 64 bit and install it on any directory. Once we installed it, then we need to open it and start "Apache" (php server)and "MySql" (database) in it. then we can access both in 
browser using following urls.
http://localhost/xampp/ 
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

Then we can create any folder in xampp folder of installed folder such as F:\xamppnew\htdocs\xampp\testphpwebsite and access it in url using http://localhost/phpmyadmin/testphpwebsite

To install wordpress, we need to download wordpress, then extract it in xampp folder, then create database in http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ such as newdatabase , then access wordpress folder
in http://localhost/xampp/wordpress , then we need to following details.

Database Name:   newdatabase 
Username:        root
Password:        keep it blank
Database Host:   localhost
Table Prefix:    wp_

Then keep continuing till wordpress gets installed and note down the login details for future use.
